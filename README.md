# adapt-scrollPrompt

The **Scroll Prompt** extension is a visual aid that helps users navigate through a course.

The plugin adds a button that will auto scroll to the next element. This button can be appended to menu headers, page headers, blocks, and components. For blocks and components, the button will be placed at the end of the block / component to ensure content is not skipped over. Additional instruction text can be applied alongside the button.
