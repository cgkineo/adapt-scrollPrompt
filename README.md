# adapt-scrollPrompt

The **Scroll Prompt** extension is a visual aid that helps users navigate through a course. The plugin adds a button that will auto scroll to the next element when clicked.

This button can be appended to:

- Menu headers
- Page headers
- Blocks
- Components

For blocks and components, the button will be placed at the end of the block / component to ensure content is not skipped over. Additional instruction text can be applied alongside the button.
